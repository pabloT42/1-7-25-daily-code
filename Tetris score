#Alter this code so it asks a user for how many lines they cleared in Tetris. The program prints out the following for each score tier:
# Novice: 0-100 lines
# Intermediate: 100-200 lines
# Advanced: 200-300 lines
# Expert: 300+ lines


score = int(input("Enter your score: "))
if score < 100:
    print("novice")
elif score < 200:
    print ("intermediate")
elif score < 300:
    print ("advanced")
else:
    print ("expert")
